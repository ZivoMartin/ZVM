ZVM (Zig Virtual Machine)

**⚠️ Work in Progress ⚠️**
ZVM is currently under development and not fully functional. However, if you'd like to explore or experiment with it, follow the instructions below.
Getting Started

To run the project:

```bash
zig build run
```

Note: The latest changes might have introduced issues that prevent the project from compiling. If you encounter problems, consider checking out an earlier commit from the repository's history.
Features

    Nuzima Bytecode Execution:
    ZVM is designed to execute Nuzima bytecode files. You can assemble these files using the Nuzima assembler (available separately).

    Multi-Process Support:
    ZVM supports running multiple processes simultaneously. However, terminal background operations are not yet implemented.

Roadmap

    File System Implementation:
    The current focus is on building a robust file system for ZVM. Stay tuned for updates as development progresses.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or share feedback to help improve ZVM!
